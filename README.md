### Shrink json

Can compress a json structure into a small human-readable and ansi-colored string.

- Arrays of big objects show only the first item, unless there is less than 3 elements
- Date formats are converted to human-readable dates
- Number, text and booleans have own colors
- Properties with child objects are high-lighted
